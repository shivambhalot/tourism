    <p>Boasting rich history and rapid industrialization, Indore is famously known for its cotton handloom industry, magnificent palaces and temples, street food, night markets, and more. No wonder the city is slowly becoming a preferred destination for travelers from across the county.
      Indore is a city in west-central India. It’s known for the 7-story Rajwada Palace and the Lal Baag Palace, which date back to Indore’s 19th-century Holkar dynasty. The Holkar rulers are honored by a cluster of tombs and cenotaphs at Chhatri Baag. The night market Sarafa Bazar sells street food. East is the Indo-Gothic Gandhi Hall and clock tower. The Jain temple Kanch Mandir has a mirrored mosaic interior.<br>
      Indore has been selected as one of the 100 Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under the Smart Cities Mission.[20] It also qualified the first round of Smart Cities Mission and was selected as one of the first twenty cities to be developed as Smart Cities.[21] Indore has been part of Swachh Survekshan since its inception and had ranked 25th in 2016.[22] It has been ranked as India's cleanest city six years in a row as per the Swachh Survekshan for the years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022</br>
